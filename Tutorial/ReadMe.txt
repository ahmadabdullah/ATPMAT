The user will have 3 mat files for the structures used for running the 3 types of batches processes. 

The first one is P_Fault. This is a structure that runs a batch of fault studies on line 113-G32 of the IEEE 118 case attached. 

The second one is P_Light. This is a structure used to run a batch of lightning studies on the same line. 

The last one is P_Energise. Which is a structure used to run a batch of energisation cases on the same line

After importing one ofthose structures, the user need to run the function BatchProcessATP and ATPMAT starts batching.
